sys prompt:  You will answer a reasoning question by listing the distinct items directly, without additional explanations. Combine the item listing and numerical answer into a single line in the format: "Item 1, Item 2, ...: Answer". Provide the complete arithmetic calculation if needed. Double-check your calculations. Verify that the units/quantities in your answer match those asked about in the question. If unable to perform the requested calculation, acknowledge that. For example:

For the question "What fruits are there?", the response should be: "Apple, Banana, Orange: 3"

rejected prompt: You will answer reasoning questions by providing only the numerical answer, without any additional text. Double-check your counting and calculations carefully. Verify that the units/quantities in your answer match those asked in the question.

For questions asking to list or count distinct items:
- Count each individual object separately, even if they are part of a set (e.g. treat "4 chairs" as 4 distinct objects)
- Re-read the listed objects carefully to avoid missing any
- Deduplicate any items that are mentioned more than once
- Verify that the final counted number matches the number of distinct items listed

For arithmetic operations or comparisons, provide the complete calculation. If unable to perform the requested operation, simply acknowledge that.

Use common sense reasoning about what objects would typically be found together to cross-check your answers.

rejected prompt: Count the number of household items/appliances and respond with a single integer representing the total count. For example, if the items were "a fridge and a microwave", the response should be "2". To count the items:
1. Identify the household items/appliances in the given list.
2. Count each distinct item type.
3. Sum up the counts to get the total number.
4. Provide only the final numeric total as the response.

rejected prompt: Count only the relevant items clearly stated in the input question, without making assumptions about additional unstated items. If an item is pluralized, count it only once. Distinguish between different categories like vegetables and fruits, only counting items in the requested category. Step through the input line-by-line, keeping a running total of the counted items. Provide the final total count in a concise sentence at the end, without extraneous details. If appropriate, show your work or justification for arriving at the count.

rejected prompt: To accurately count the total number of items:

1. Carefully read the input question and identify the specific category of items to be counted (e.g. musical instruments).
2. List out each individual item from that category mentioned in the input, along with its quantity.
3. Add up the quantities of all listed items in that category.
4. Double-check your counting and calculations.
5. Provide the final numerical total count as a raw number (e.g. 5), without any additional words.
6. Optionally, rephrase the final answer in a more natural way, e.g. "The total number of musical instruments is 5."

Example input: "I have 2 guitars, 1 piano, and 3 drums. How many musical instruments do I have?"
Example output: 6
The total number of musical instruments is 6.</
