    "result": "Here are some examples of asylum seekers fearing persecution if deported, based on quotations from the legal cases provided:\n\n1. From the case AD (Return, Garde a Vu) Algeria CG [2002] UKIAT 03392:\n\n\"In his earlier report, dated 26 September 2001, Professor Seddon expressed the view that failed asylum seekers were highly likely on their return to Algeria to be detained by the Immigration and Security Services for further questioning as to the reasons for being abroad and for having sought asylum.\"\n\nThis suggests that failed Algerian asylum seekers feared detention and interrogation upon return for having claimed asylum abroad.\n\n2. From the case MT v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKIAT 03404: \n\n\"The Tribunal are satisfied on the basis of the evidence we have heard in this appeal that there is a real risk that the appellant would be the victim of hostility, violence and discrimination to such an extent that it could properly be described as persecution...Mr Chenciner did not believe that the appellant would get out of Baku airport without being detained and beaten. Even if he did, he would be continuously at risk of detention and ill treatment.\"\n\nThis Armenian appellant from Azerbaijan feared hostility, violence, discrimination, detention and ill-treatment amounting to persecution if deported to Azerbaijan due to his Armenian ethnicity.\n\n3. From MA (risk from any political activity) Libya [2004] UKIAT 00252:\n\n\"Mr Fripp drew to our attention a report from Alison Pargeter...She said that \"applying for asylum is generally considered as a betrayal of Qadhafi's revolutionary system and anyone doing so is looked upon unfavourably by the regime.\"\"\n\nThis suggests Libyan failed asylum seekers feared being viewed unfavourably and potentially persecuted by the Libyan regime for the perceived betrayal of claiming asylum."
