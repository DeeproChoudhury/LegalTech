    "result": "Here are some examples of asylum seekers fearing persecution if deported, as evidenced by quotes from previous legal cases:\n\n1. In MT v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKIAT 03404, the Tribunal accepted that MT, an Azerbaijani man of mixed Azerbaijani and Armenian ethnicity, would face persecution if returned to Azerbaijan, stating:\n\n\"The Tribunal are satisfied on the basis of the evidence we have heard in this appeal that there is a real risk that the appellant would be the victim of hostility, violence and discrimination to such an extent that it could properly be described as persecution...Mr Chenciner did not believe that the appellant would get out of Baku airport without being detained and beaten. Even if he did, he would be continuously at risk of detention and ill treatment.\"\n\n2. In AD (Return, Garde a Vu) Algeria CG [2002] UKIAT 03392, the Tribunal considered the case of an Algerian failed asylum seeker and stated:\n\n\"We accept that there might be some reluctance amongst people returned and their representatives to complain, we cannot ignore the apparent entire absence of any complaint being recorded by or on behalf of anybody who has been returned to Algeria. The fact that a number of countries return hundreds of people to Algeria and the absence of any reported complaints must speak for itself.\"\n\nThis suggests that while failed asylum seekers may fear persecution upon return to Algeria, the evidence did not substantiate such a risk.\n\n3. In RS (failed asylum seekers) Syria [2004] UKIAT 00257, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal of a Syrian failed asylum seeker, stating there was no evidence \"to show that there is any real risk to this appellant, if he is now returned to Syria using his own papers as he is entitled to do, that he would be reasonably likely either to be persecuted for a Refugee Convention reason or to be treated in breach of his protected human rights.\"\n\nSo in summary, the legal cases provide examples where asylum seekers' fears of persecution on return were accepted (MT) and rejected (AD and RS), based on the specific evidence presented in each case.",
