Here are some examples of asylum seekers fearing persecution if deported, with relevant quotes from the legal cases provided:

1. In the case of MT v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKIAT 03404, the Tribunal accepted that MT, an Azerbaijani man of Armenian ethnic origin, would face persecution if returned to Azerbaijan:

"The Tribunal are satisfied on the basis of the evidence we have heard in this appeal that there is a real risk that the appellant would be the victim of hostility, violence and discrimination to such an extent that it could properly be described as persecution...Mr Chenciner did not believe that the appellant would get out of Baku airport without being detained and beaten. Even if he did, he would be continuously at risk of detention and ill treatment."

2. In AD (Return, Garde a Vu) Algeria CG [2002] UKIAT 03392, the Tribunal acknowledged the risk of detention and ill-treatment for failed asylum seekers returned to Algeria:

"Professor Seddon expressed the view that failed asylum seekers were highly likely on their return to Algeria to be detained by the Immigration and Security Services for further questioning...and there remains a strong risk that they will be subjected to brutal, inhuman and degrading treatment."

3. In RS (failed asylum seekers) Syria [2004] UKIAT 00257, the evidence suggested failed asylum seekers could face difficulties if forcibly returned:

"An Amnesty International report of January 2004 says that seeking political asylum abroad is perceived to be the act of government opponents by the Syrian authorities and that the very fact of leaving the country to seek asylum abroad is imputed to be a manifestation of opposition to the Syrian government."
