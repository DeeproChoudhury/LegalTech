('Here are some examples of asylum seekers fearing persecution if deported, '
 'based on the legal cases provided:\n'
 '\n'
 '1. From MT v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKIAT 03404:\n'
 '\n'
 'The Tribunal accepted the expert evidence of Mr. Chenciner that MT, an Azeri '
 'man of Armenian ethnic origin, would face "hostility, violence and '
 'discrimination to such an extent that it could properly be described as '
 'persecution" if deported to Azerbaijan. The determination states:\n'
 '\n'
 '"The Tribunal are satisfied on the basis of the evidence we have heard in '
 'this appeal that there is a real risk that the appellant would be the victim '
 'of hostility, violence and discrimination to such an extent that it could '
 'properly be described as persecution...Mr Chenciner did not believe that the '
 'appellant would get out of Baku airport without being detained and beaten. '
 'Even if he did, he would be continuously at risk of detention and ill '
 'treatment."\n'
 '\n'
 '2. From AD (Return, Garde a Vu) Algeria CG [2002] UKIAT 03392: \n'
 '\n'
 'While the Tribunal did not find a real risk to AD himself as a failed '
 'Algerian asylum seeker, it acknowledged the possibility of persecution in '
 'certain cases:\n'
 '\n'
 '"We note the various comments of the experts as set out at paragraph 5 of '
 'the skeleton argument and, in particular, the quotation from Dr Roberts, '
 'albeit it in a somewhat different context from this case. We note his '
 'comment that a failed asylum seeker would have that fact held against him '
 'and it could have consequences prejudicial to his safety."\n'
 '\n'
 'The determination also cites an expert report stating "those who are '
 'detained for questioning may be held garde Ã  vue (incommunicado) for up to a '
 'week or so in order to allow stories to be checked and records '
 'consulted...in detention there remains a strong risk that they will be '
 'subjected to brutal, inhuman and degrading treatment."')
