United Kingdom Asylum and Immigration Tribunal
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Since February 2010 appeals against
decisions relating to Asylum and Immigration are found in BAILII's
Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)
database.
The Post February 2010 decisions of this type are sourced from:
Judiciary of England and Wales Tribunal Decisions
Pre - February 2010 information:
The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal is the successor to the Immigration Appellate Authority and the Immigration Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal was set up under the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004 and came into being on 4th April 2005. The purpose of the Tribunal is to hear and decide appeals against decisions made by the Home Office in matters of asylum, immigration and nationality.
Reported determinations receive a neutral citation number of the form
[2003] UKIAT 00001
. They are anonymised and are to be cited by the neutral citation number.
Starred determinations (indicated as such with STARRED being the first word in the title of the determination)  have a special status. They are to be treated as binding by all Adjudicators and the Tribunal unless inconsistent with authority binding on the Appellate Authorities.
Important:
This is simply a list of starred determinations. The inclusion of a determination on this list does not indicate that it is still good law.
Listed below are the pre - February 2010 Country Guideline (CG) determinations (indicated as such by CG indicated as the word before the citation date in the title of the determination) are selected determinations that represent current trends in decisions for the given country.
