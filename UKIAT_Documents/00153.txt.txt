Note from the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal:
The case awarded number [2004] UKIAT 00153 had previously been awarded number [2003] UKIAT 00206.
This case was re-reported in error.
It has been removed and the version

    used.
No other case shall be awarded [2004] UKIAT 00153 in order to ensure 
    there is no confusion.
BAILII note:
DK (Return, Ethic Serb, Upheld, SK Accommodation) Croatia CG
[2003] UKIAT 00153
(20 November 2003) is sometimes wrongly cited as being [2004] rather than [2003]
