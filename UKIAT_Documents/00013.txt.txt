APPEAL No.
[2004] UKIAT 00013 A (Azerbaijan)
IMMIGRATION APPEAL TRIBUNAL
Date of hearing: 20 January 2004
Date Determination notified: 04 February 2004
Before
Mr J Freeman (chairman)
Mr D J Parkes
Mrs W Jordan
Between
A
APPELLANT
and
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME 
        DEPARTMENT
RESPONDENT
Miss S Haji (counsel instructed by Dozie & Co) for the 
  claimant
Miss J Sigley for the Secretary of State
DETERMINATION AND REASONS
This is what purports to be an appeal against the decision of an 
  adjudicator, Mr P Brenells, sitting at Taylor House on 15 May 2003. We say 
  "purports", because the adjudicator ended his decision by upholding the 
  Secretary of State's certificate. This was not the kind of certificate, with 
  which everybody is familiar, certifying only the asylum appeal, because there 
  had already been a human rights claim before the Secretary of State; and it is 
  quite clear that the certificate applied to the claim as a whole. It follows 
  that it was not caught by the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Zenovics
[2002] EWCA Civ 273
, and it must be regarded as
prima facie
valid.
We raised this point, because it occurred to Mr 
  Parkes, who had given permission in this case, that, on a correct view of the 
  law, the certificate had prevented him from considering any such application 
  at all. Miss Haji asked us to disregard the certificate, on the basis that 
  current policy was to withdraw all certificates issued under the 1999 Act. 
  Miss Sigley pointed out that that policy only came into operation as from June 
  2003; so probably did not cover the present decision, which was issued on 11 
  June. Certainly, there had been no withdrawal before the adjudicator.
While the delay and cost to public funds is 
  regrettable, we cannot accept Ms Haji's argument that either the legitimate 
  expectation, such as it may have been, that an appeal would be heard by the 
  Tribunal; or the change in Home Office policy, since the adjudicator's 
  decision, could possibly confer a power on us to hear such an appeal, which 
  the statute does not give us. We are a creature of statute and cannot get our 
  powers from any other source. It follows that there is
no valid appeal 
  before the Tribunal
, and the parties must take such further action to deal 
  with the adjudicator's decision as they see fit.
John Freeman
(chairman)
